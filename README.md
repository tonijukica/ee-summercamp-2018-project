Team Susnjara EE Summer Camp 2018 project

## Development guidelines
Some conventions we want to enforce cannot be covered by automated tools. They will ensure that our process and code is clean and consistent.

### Directory and file naming schemes
#### Server
- filenames are kebab-cased: `kebab-case-file.js`
- directories are kebab-cased: `server/models/user-answer`

#### Client
- React components are camelcased and capitalized (PascalCase): `RegisterForm.js`
- React component's directories are camelcased and capitalized (PascalCase): `components/RegisterForm`
